                Dear Mom,
            </p>
            <p>
                You are the heart of our family, the gentle voice that lifts my spirits, and the hands that have always guided me through life’s storms. Your love has been my sanctuary, your wisdom my compass, and your hugs the safest place I know.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for every sacrifice, every smile, and every moment of unconditional love. You’ve shown me the true meaning of strength, kindness, and grace. I am who I am today because of you.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are my forever hero, my first best friend, and my greatest blessing. I love you endlessly.
            </p>

                With all my heart,<br>Your Child
